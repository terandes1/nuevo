From the upper part, these circular terraces look like an ancient amphitheater, though some experts believe they served as agricultural laboratories where the Incas could experiment with new farming techniques as well as a process of acclimatization of some plants. Of course, this is just one of the various theories, and even after many years of research and dozens of hypotheses, but still the true purpose of Moray remains as a mystery. This day, you are going to inspect the site yourself and have your own theories.

The city was constructed in a harmonious and symmetric way, in blocks with straight streets that embraced many sectors such as the administrative, ceremonial, urban, defensive and a road system. 
                                                The inhabitants constructed the walls with a combination of mud and stone, all of them wide at the bottom and narrow at the upper part. Room walls and floors were also made with a kind of thick plaster showing the appearance of a white city.
