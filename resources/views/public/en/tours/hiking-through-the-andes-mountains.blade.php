                                                Tour to the agricultural terraces of Moray and the saltpans of Maras.
                                                After breakfast, we will drive towards the enigmatic Inca ruins at Moray. Once we reach the site, we will observe from the upper part, a set of circular terraces that look like an ancient amphitheater, though some experts believe they served as agricultural laboratories where the Incas could experiment with new farming techniques as well as a process of acclimatization of some plants. Of course, this is just one of the various theories, and even after many years of research and dozens of hypotheses, but still the true purpose of Moray remains as a mystery. This day, you are going to inspect the site yourself and have your own theories.
                                                Depart from the intriguing Moray and continue to the small town of Maras, home of an old salt mine that dates from the Inca times. This place comprises thousands of milky pools, each set on its own terrace along the hillside, the saltpans are particularly surreal in appearance and incredibly photogenic. Members of the community own the pans and they have been passed down through the local families since pre-Inca times.
                                                We will visit the town of Maras where we will enjoy some activities such as knitting in corn leaves, working on ceramics or visiting the hat maker. At the end of the day, we will drive you back to your hotel. 
                                                Overnight in the Sacred Valley.

As you gradually make your way up these mountain trails, you will encounter expansive plateaus dotted with boulders of varying sizes, the remnants of a valley that was once bisected by a fast-flowing river. The final and most challenging part of your ascent is conquering the mountain switchbacks that take you to the Salkantay Pass, the highest point on the trek, around 15,213 ft.
                                                What follows is a dramatic descent through fields of giant boulders, often shrouded in fog. After a welcome hot picnic lunch, you will continue the way down through bucolic rolling hills and marsh-like plateaus as you take your final steps to the Wayra Lodge at Wayraccmachay.
