The main plaza has six pyramids clustered around a plaza. The “Templo Mayor”, called “The Grand Temple” in English, is the largest temple in the city and has the largest base of any temple in Peru. Archaeologists say that in the past, it was an incredibly imposing structure.

                                                After breakfast, we will continue our adventure with a trip to a nice highland spot, which is located not far away from the breathtaking Lake of Piuray. The village of Chinchero is well known because of its textile tradition, here you will have an opportunity to talk and interact with the weavers who will share some of their knowledge with you.
                                                After visiting this place, our tour will continue with the visit of the enigmatic Inca ruins at Moray. From the upper part, these circular terraces look like an ancient amphitheater, though some experts believe they served as agricultural laboratories where the Incas could experiment with new farming techniques as well as a process of acclimatization of some plants. Of course, this is just one of the various theories, and even after many years of research and dozens of hypotheses, but still the true purpose of Moray remains as a mystery. This day, you are going to inspect the site yourself and have your own theories.
                                                Depart from the intriguing Moray and continue to the small town of Maras, home of an old salt mine that dates from the Inca times. This place comprises thousands of milky pools, each set on its own terrace along the hillside, the saltpans are particularly surreal in appearance and incredibly photogenic. The pans are owned individually and they have been passed down through the local families since pre-Inca times.
                                                At the end of the day, we will drive you back to your hotel.

                                                Morning tour to explore the nearby ruins of the city.
                                                This morning, we will drive to the upper part where we are going to explore the most representative Inca sites that surround the city, first we will explore Sacsayhuaman, an incredible megalithic construction that in the past was considered as a fortress, but recent excavations proved that it was a religious center. We will continue our explorations visiting Q’enko, a ceremonial place where we will see its labyrinth and a very particular structure similar to an amphitheater. On the way back to the city, we will stop by San Cristobal neighborhood where we will have moment to explore the palace of the Inca Manco Capac; here we will enjoy some drinks and an impressive view of the city. Return to your hotel.
