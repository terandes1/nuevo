                                                After breakfast, we will continue our adventure with a trip to a nice highland spot, which is located not far away from the breathtaking Lake of Piuray. The village of Chinchero is well known because of its textile tradition, here you will have an opportunity to talk and interact with the weavers who will share some of their knowledge with you.
                                                After visiting this place, our tour will continue with the visit of the enigmatic Inca ruins at Moray. From the upper part, these circular terraces look like an ancient amphitheater, though some experts believe they served as agricultural laboratories where the Incas could experiment with new farming techniques as well as a process of acclimatization of some plants. Of course, this is just one of the various theories, and even after many years of research and dozens of hypotheses, but still the true purpose of Moray remains as a mystery. This day, you are going to inspect the site yourself and have your own theories.
                                                Depart from the intriguing Moray and continue to the small town of Maras, home of an old salt mine that dates from the Inca times. This place comprises thousands of milky pools, each set on its own terrace along the hillside, the saltpans are particularly surreal in appearance and incredibly photogenic. The pans are individually owned and have been passed down through the local families since pre-Inca times.
                                                Once we return from seeing the saltpans, we will have a set of activities to do in town, for the young members of the group; we will build kites or take a ceramic class.
                                                Another option might be to take a bike ride in the surroundings of the community.
                                                At the end of the day, we will drive you back to your hotel.

                                                Full day tour to the Islands of the Uros and Amantani.
                                                This day, you will spend a time to immerse in a learning about indigenous cultures; this is with no doubt a valuable and rewarding experience and an essential component of our fully customized travel programs in any of our selected destinations. You are going to visit some of the living communities of the islands who make their home on the shores of Lake Titicaca. Located at around 12,500 feet above sea level, Titicaca is considered the world’s highest navigable lake.
                                                The adventure will take you to navigate through banks of reeds to the incredible floating islands of Uros, which are home to a self-sufficient island community. The Uros communities have lived on these fabricated islands for hundreds of years; they have built the floating islands using the local totora reed and work permanently in the maintenance of them.
                                                After spending a time visiting and learning about the lifestyle of the Uros people, you will embark on a motorboat ride to the island of Taquile, located just beyond the Bay of Puno. The view of its grassy cliffs falling into the blue waters, from the distance resemble very much a Mediterranean scenery. On your arrival, the Quechua-speaking residents will meet and greet you. They are renowned for their skillful textiles; during your visit, they will share some of their ancestral textile legacy and they will explain about the knitting patterns. In the afternoon, you will return to your hotel for a relaxing evening.
                                                Overnight Titilaka Lodge.
